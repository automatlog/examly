## Inspiration
Our main source of inspiration was Vedantu. We wanted to provide a website that is both beautiful and functional, designed to serve its purpose and make an impact on students life.

## What it does
The Examly app helps the user to improve and become more successful in cracking entrance exams. It is a gamified learning platform that provides real-time feedback on their performance, with the goal of enhancing exam preparation skills.

## How we built it
Using HTML , CSS , JS, Bootstrap 

## Challenges we ran into
Making UI/UX was the main challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We gained knowledge about how to manage a team, work on a project with the input of the entire team, and work with a team.

## What we learned
One of the most important things that we learned is the importance of team working, team collaboration, and working under pressure.
We found that working with a team makes one more efficient and productive, as well as more creative. It also helped us to see different perspectives and approaches to problems. This was especially helpful when we were working on a project virtually and with completely new people

## What's next for Examly
Examly future is bright. Student can create their own account on our platform. We will create more papers for user to solve and work on.Students will also be able to see how well they are doing on each individual paper as they work on it. This gives them an opportunity to focus on what they want out of each exam, rather than being overwhelmed by everything else happening around them.They will also have access to extra materials such as flashcards so that they can memorize important information more easily than ever before
